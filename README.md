# Adapting `{epinowcast}` to have a fixed reporting schedule

## The problem

I have data that has a fixed reporting schedule (for example it is
reported weekly on a thursday at 9am). I want to use `{epinowcast}` to
nowcast the data and estimate the effective reproduction number, but I
want to be able to specify the reporting schedule.

## The solution

`{epinowcast}` doesn’t yet support this functionality, but it is
possible to adapt the package to do this.

> Before doing this note that we also have the option of pretending we
> do not know the fixed reporting schedule and so need to learn it from
> the data. This should work but it will likely not be very efficient.
> If you want to try this load the default `{epinowcast}` model in
> `main.R` rather than the adapted one.

## Getting setup with this example

1.  Clone this repository
2.  Open an R session in the root of the repository. `renv` should
    handle installing the dependencies.
3.  Make sure you have `cmdstan` installed (for example via
    `cmdstanr::install_cmdstan()`).
4.  Either run through this `README` interactively or render it using
    `quarto`.

## Load Packages

``` r
library(epinowcast)
library(data.table)
library(ggplot2)
library(here)
```

    here() starts at /home/seabbs/Dropbox/academic/projects/epinowcast-fixed-reporting-example

## Load Synthetic Data

We load in the synthetic data from `data` that we generated in
`data-raw/synthetic-weekly-data.R`. We also load in the latest available
data by reference date (i.e. the data that we want to nowcast).

``` r
rt_synth_data <- fread("data/synthetic-weekly-data.csv")
latest_synth_data <- fread("data/latest-synthetic-weekly-data.csv")
```

## Filter the latest data for the period we are nowcasting

``` r
filt_latest_synth_data <- enw_filter_reference_dates(
  latest_synth_data,
  remove_days = 40, include_days = 60
)
```

## Preprocess Observations

As for all uses of `{epinowcast}` we need to first preprocess the data.

``` r
pobs <- enw_preprocess_data(rt_synth_data, max_delay = 35)
```

    Warning in enw_add_metaobs_features(metareport, ...): Pre-existing columns in
    `metaobs` will be overwritten: {day_of_week}.

    Warning in enw_add_metaobs_features(metareference, ...): Pre-existing columns
    in `metaobs` will be overwritten: {day_of_week}.

## Compile Nowcasting Model

We now load in our custom model (`model.stan`). If we would like to use
the default model we would drop the `model` - try this out and see what
difference it makes.

``` r
model <- enw_model(
  model = here("model.stan"),
  threads = TRUE, stanc_options = list("O1")
)
```

    Using model /home/seabbs/Dropbox/academic/projects/epinowcast-fixed-reporting-example/model.stan.

    include is /home/seabbs/.cache/R/renv/cache/v5/R-4.3/x86_64-pc-linux-gnu/epinowcast/0.2.3.2000/642a461f38b2083f8c696a37edb32486/epinowcast/stan.

## Define Expectation Model

This model includes:

- A random walk on the log of expected cases.
- A generation time with probability mass spread over 4 days.
- A latent reporting delay representing the incubation period and
  assumed ascertainment.
- A day of the week reporting effect.

``` r
expectation_module <- enw_expectation(
  r = ~ 1 + rw(week),
  generation_time = c(0.1, 0.4, 0.4, 0.1),
  observation = ~ (1 | day_of_week),
  latent_reporting_delay = c(0.05, 0.3, 0.6, 0.05),
  data = pobs
)
```

## Define Reference Date Model

This model assumes a non-parametric reporting process with a random
effect on the week of the delay.

``` r
reference_module <- enw_reference(~ 1, data = pobs)
```

## Define Report Date Model

This model accounts for the day of the week reporting effect using a
binary indicator “not_thursday” which is present in our syntrhetic data.

``` r
report_module <- enw_report(~ not_thursday, data = pobs)
```

## Fit Nowcast Model

We’ll fit the model with the modules defined above and produce a
nowcast.

``` r
# | echo: true
# | output: false
nowcast <- epinowcast(pobs,
  expectation = expectation_module,
  reference = reference_module,
  report = report_module,
  fit = enw_fit_opts(
    save_warmup = FALSE, pp = TRUE,
    # Warning: I have 16 cores and so this setting is fine for me
    # but you need to change it if you have fewer cores (or more!)
    # so that chains * threads_per_chain = your number of cores
    # of cores.
    chains = 4, threads_per_chain = 4,
    parallel_chains = 4,
    iter_warmup = 1000, iter_sampling = 1000,
    adapt_delta = 0.96
  ),
  model = model
)
```

    Running MCMC with 4 parallel chains, with 4 thread(s) per chain...

### Posterior Predictions by Report and Reference Date

``` r
plot(nowcast, type = "posterior") +
